# Excel Data Analysis & Visualisation Labs

This project showcases two hands-on labs that I completed to analyse and visualise data using **Microsoft Excel**. Users will learn how to create pivot tables, generate charts, and format visualisations for clear data interpretation.

---

## Lab 1: Pivot Tables & Data Visualisation

In this lab, I:

* Create a Pivot Table to explore bicycle sales data.
* Analyse demographic purchasing patterns.
* Rearrange, group, and refine pivot table layouts.
* Add gender and age segmentation for deeper insights.
* Generate a stacked column chart based on pivot table results.
* Use the visualisation to identify sales trends and marketing opportunities.

### **What This Shows**

* Pivot tables showing age groups, countries, and order quantities.
* Collapsible groupings for easier data exploration.
* Cleaned and formatted tables with zero-filled empty cells.
* A stacked column chart titled **"Sales Summary"**, visually comparing demographics.

## Lab 2: Data Visualisation (Line, Column, Pie Charts)

This lab focuses entirely on chart creation and formatting. I:

* Build a **Line Chart** comparing Revenue and Profit from 2017–2021.
* Create a **Stacked Column Chart** showing product revenue by country.
* Generate a **Pie Chart** illustrating revenue distribution across age groups.
* Add titles, format legends, adjust axis labels, and add data labels.

### **What This Shows**

* A line chart titled **"Revenue vs. Profits"** with currency formatting and axis titles.
* A stacked column chart titled **"Product Revenue by Country"**.
* A pie chart titled **"Revenue Comparison by Age Group"** with category and percentage labels.
